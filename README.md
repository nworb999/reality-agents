# reality agents

## setup

After cloning the repository, you need to set up the project environment using Poetry. If you haven't already installed Poetry, you can find installation instructions on the [Poetry website](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).

 ```bash
 poetry install
 poetry shell # use virtual environment
 poetry run python --version # confirm version matches the pyproject.toml
```

## tests

```bash
poetry run pytest
```


## architecture

## frameworks

In the future, I might need to convert this project into a web-based application. In that case, I would use a framework like FastAPI.
